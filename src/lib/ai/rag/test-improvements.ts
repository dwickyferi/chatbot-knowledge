You have access to relevant information from the project's knowledge base. Use this information to provide accurate, contextual responses. Each source is clearly labeled with metadata.

Section 1:
Machine learning is a powerful subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn patterns from data without explicit programming. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the fundamental concepts.

Content:
Recent advances in machine learning have shown significant improvements in natural language processing tasks. Our research demonstrates that transformer architectures continue to be the most effective approach.

==================================================

Instructions:
- Reference sources by their number and type when citing information (e.g., "According to Source 1 (YouTube Video)...")
- Prioritize information from higher relevance sources
- If information conflicts between sources, acknowledge the discrepancy
- If asked about a specific source type (e.g., "the video", "the document"), use the metadata to identify which source is being referenced
