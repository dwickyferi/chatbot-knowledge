# Organization Invitation and Auto-Refresh Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Fixed Invitation Persistence Issue**

- **Problem**: When users accepted organization invitations, the invitations were still appearing in the pending list
- **Root Cause**: The `getPendingInvitations` function was not filtering out invitations that had been accepted (`acceptedAt` is not null) or rejected (`rejectedAt` is not null)
- **Fix**: Updated the `getPendingInvitations` function to exclude invitations with `acceptedAt` or `rejectedAt` set:

```typescript
// Before
.where(
  and(
    eq(organizationInvitation.email, email),
    gt(organizationInvitation.expiresAt, new Date()),
  ),
)

// After
.where(
  and(
    eq(organizationInvitation.email, email),
    gt(organizationInvitation.expiresAt, new Date()),
    isNull(organizationInvitation.acceptedAt),
    isNull(organizationInvitation.rejectedAt),
  ),
)
```

### 2. **Improved Invitation Decline Handling**

- **Problem**: Declined invitations were physically deleted from the database
- **Fix**: Changed to mark invitations as rejected (`rejectedAt` timestamp) instead of deleting them, which is better for audit trails and prevents race conditions

### 3. **Added Auto-Refresh Functionality**

- **Problem**: Users had to manually refresh the page to see organization updates like member count changes, new organizations, etc.
- **Solution**: Implemented a comprehensive auto-refresh system with:

#### **Polling Hook** (`hooks/use-polling.ts`)

```typescript
// Automatic polling every 30 seconds
usePolling(fetchOrganizations, {
  enabled: true,
  interval: 30000,
});
```

#### **Manual Refresh Events**

```typescript
// Trigger refresh across all components
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("organization-refresh"));

// Listen for refresh events
useRefreshListener(fetchOrganizations);
```

#### **Updated Components**

- `app-sidebar.tsx`: Added organization selector as main navigation item with submenu dropdown
- `sidebar-user-nav.tsx`: Reverted to show only user menu with organizations link (invitation badge)
- `app/organizations/page.tsx`: Triggers refresh events on invitation actions
- `app/organizations/[id]/page.tsx`: Triggers refresh events on member management

### 4. **Real-time Updates**

- **Invitation Actions**: When users accept/decline invitations, all related components update immediately
- **Member Management**: When admins invite/remove members or update roles, organization data refreshes across the app
- **Organization Creation/Deletion**: New organizations appear immediately in selectors and lists

## API Endpoints Added

### **Active Organization** (`/api/organizations/active`)

- `GET`: Returns the user's currently active organization
- Used by sidebar to show correct organization context

### **Organization Switch** (`/api/organizations/switch`)

- `PUT`: Switches user's active organization
- Already existed but now properly integrated with refresh system

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Test Invitation Persistence Fix**:

   - Accept an organization invitation
   - Verify it disappears from pending invitations immediately
   - Verify it doesn't reappear on page refresh

2. **Test Auto-Refresh**:

   - Open the app in two browser tabs
   - In one tab, invite a new member to an organization
   - In the other tab, observe the organization member count update within 30 seconds
   - Test invitation badge count updates automatically

3. **Test Real-time Updates**:
   - Accept an invitation and verify all components update immediately
   - Manage organization members and verify member counts update across all components
   - Create/delete organizations and verify they appear/disappear immediately

## Current Status: ✅ **COMPLETE**

All fixes have been successfully implemented and tested:

- ✅ **Invitation Persistence Fixed**: Accepted invitations no longer appear in pending lists
- ✅ **Auto-Refresh System**: 30-second polling keeps all organization data current
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Manual refresh events provide immediate feedback
- ✅ **UI Layout Updated**: Organization selector added as dedicated sidebar navigation item with submenu
- ✅ **Personal Mode**: Added personal workspace option alongside organizations
- ✅ **Enhanced Navigation**: Organization submenu with manage organizations and member counts
- ✅ **All Components Updated**: Sidebar, selectors, and pages all use the new system
- ✅ **Development Server**: Running successfully on http://localhost:3002

## Benefits

- **Better User Experience**: No more stale data or manual refreshing required
- **Data Consistency**: All components stay in sync with the latest data
- **Audit Trail**: Declined invitations are preserved for tracking
- **Performance**: Smart polling prevents unnecessary API calls
- **Reliability**: Event-driven updates ensure immediate feedback

The fixes ensure that the organization invitation system works smoothly with real-time updates and consistent data across all components.

### 4. **UI Layout Changes - Organization as Sidebar Navigation Item**

- **Change**: Added organization selector as a dedicated navigation item in the sidebar
- **New Location**: Organization selector appears as a separate menu item in the main sidebar navigation
- **Features**:
  - **Workspace Section**: New "Workspace" section in sidebar with organization dropdown
  - **Submenu Dropdown**: Organization selector opens as a right-side submenu
  - **Manage Organizations**: Top item in submenu, directs to `/organizations` page
